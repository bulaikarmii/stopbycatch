## #STOPBYCATCH

#STOPBYCATCH aims to raise awareness about the issue of bycatch in commercial fishing. While targeted fish species are intended for sale and consumption, many other species are inadvertently caught as bycatch and thrown back into the sea. Often, these caught animals do not survive the capture and release process, leading to a wastage of resources and a negative impact on the marine environment. The campaign calls on consumers to make conscious choices when purchasing fish products by preferring sustainably certified options. The fishing industry is urged to employ more selective fishing methods and innovative technologies to reduce bycatch and promote marine conservation. The campaign illustrates the impacts of bycatch through circles of varying sizes, growth rates, and density, with numbers in the corners indicating the increase in bycatch per second. It showcases the most deadly nets and regions with the highest bycatch to raise awareness about the impacts of bycatch in the fishing industry. #STOPBYCATCH aims to minimize the rate of bycatch and promote a sustainable fishing industry by educating the public.
